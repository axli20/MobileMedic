### MobileMedic App

##### How to Download (macOS)

_**Required Software**_
- Node.js (online download)
- Expo (run `npm install -g expo-cli`)

Download Node.js before installing Expo. Make sure to create an Expo account if you don't already have one. Expo will be the software that will simulate the app on macOS's iOS simulator.

Install the software above, then follow the instructions below.

Expo also has a mobile app for iOS, where app simulations can be run directly on your mobile phone.

_**Running Instructions**_

1. Copy the repo into a folder on your computer.
2. Navigate into the MobileMedic folder, and in the terminal window, type command `expo start`
3. If you encounter any error messages, follow the directions in the messages.
4. Otherwise, you should see Expo open a window in your browser.
5. Type `i` into the terminal window and hit enter. This should open the iOS simulator.
6. The app should bundle and appear on the simulator!
